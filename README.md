# RN4020-BLE-MODULE
A long time ago, I wanted to use the RN4020 Microchip BLE module in one of my projects but the starter kit was expensive so I got a customised board that houses the BLE module in it.
The details of the RN4020 can be found here: http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/RN4020

This repository contains the gerber and schematic of the board.
